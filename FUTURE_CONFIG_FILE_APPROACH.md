# Config File Approach for Project-Aware Monitoring

**Status**: Future enhancement idea  
**Context**: Emerged from wherewasi integration discussion  
**Enterprise Background**: Patterns from Mileviewer/Maersk-scale monitoring systems

## üéØ The Vision: Monitoring as Code

**Current doggowoof**: Universal webhook receiver ‚Üí alerts  
**Enhanced doggowoof**: Project-specific config files ‚Üí intelligent, context-aware alerts

## üèóÔ∏è Proposed Architecture

### Project-Level Configuration
Each monitored project would have a `doggowoof.yml` in its repository:

```yaml
# wherewasi/doggowoof.yml
name: wherewasi
description: "AI context generation CLI - ripcord monitoring"

github:
  repository: "QRY91/wherewasi"
  events: [workflow_run, issues, pull_request]
  
  alerts:
    - name: "CI Pipeline Failure"
      event: "workflow_run"
      condition: "conclusion == 'failure'"
      priority: "critical"
      message: "ü™Ç WHEREWASI CI FAILED - Ripcord deployment broken!"
      
    - name: "Database Schema Change"
      event: "push"
      files: ["internal/database/database.go"]
      pattern: "CREATE TABLE|ALTER TABLE|DROP TABLE"
      priority: "medium"
      message: "üìä WHEREWASI DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGED - Migration needed?"

local:
  files: ["main.go", "internal/database/database.go", ".github/workflows/ci.yml"]
  
notifications:
  urgency_levels:
    critical: "bark_loud"
    high: "bark_normal"
    medium: "quiet_woof"
    low: "tail_wag"
```

### Cross-Project Intelligence
```yaml
# ecosystem awareness
ecosystem:
  related_projects: ["uroboro", "osmotic"]
  cross_project_patterns:
    - pattern: "database migration"
      notify_projects: ["uroboro"]  # uroboro might be affected
      message: "üîÑ Ecosystem database change detected"
```

## üéØ Advantages Over Pure Webhooks

### 1. **Project-Specific Intelligence**
- **Webhooks**: Generic "build failed" alerts
- **Config Files**: "ü™Ç Ripcord deployment broken!" with domain context

### 2. **Version Controlled Monitoring**
```bash
git log doggowoof.yml  # See how monitoring evolved
git diff HEAD~1 doggowoof.yml  # What changed in alerting?
```

### 3. **Templating & Consistency**
```yaml
# Base template for QRY ecosystem tools
templates:
  qry_tool:
    alerts:
      - name: "CI Failure"
        priority: "high"
        message: "üö® {PROJECT_NAME} CI FAILED"
```

### 4. **Advanced Logic Patterns**
```yaml
# Complex conditions hard to express in webhook setup
conditions:
  - "workflow.name == 'Wherewasi CI' && jobs.quality-gate.conclusion == 'failure'"
  - "files.changed.includes('go.mod') && event == 'push'"
  - "time.since_last_success > '2 hours'"
```

## üè¢ Enterprise Monitoring Patterns

**From Mileviewer/Maersk Scale Experience:**

### Prometheus-style Alert Rules
```yaml
# Similar to Prometheus alerting.yml
groups:
  - name: wherewasi_ci
    rules:
      - alert: CIPipelineFailing
        expr: github_workflow_status{repo="wherewasi"} == 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
          component: ci
        annotations:
          summary: "Wherewasi CI pipeline failing"
```

### Grafana-style Dashboard Configs
```yaml
# Project monitoring dashboard definition
dashboard:
  panels:
    - title: "CI Success Rate"
      type: "stat"
      targets: ["github_workflow_success_rate"]
    - title: "Recent Alerts"
      type: "logs"
      targets: ["doggowoof_alerts{project='wherewasi'}"]
```

### Infrastructure as Code Principles
- **Declarative**: Describe desired monitoring state
- **Version Controlled**: Changes tracked in git
- **Reproducible**: Same config = same monitoring
- **Self-Documenting**: Config file shows monitoring strategy

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Hybrid Approach
- Keep current webhook system working
- Add optional config file detection
- Projects can opt-in to enhanced monitoring

### Phase 2: Config-First
- Enhanced alert logic and project awareness
- Cross-project pattern detection
- Template system for common monitoring patterns

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Intelligence
- Automatic relationship detection between projects
- Smart alert correlation across QRY ecosystem
- Learning patterns from monitoring configurations

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Ideas

### Config File Discovery
```bash
# Doggowoof scans ecosystem for monitoring configs
doggo discover  # Find all doggowoof.yml files in ~/stuff/projects/
doggo validate  # Check config syntax and logic
doggo template qry_tool > doggowoof.yml  # Generate from template
```

### Enhanced CLI
```bash
doggo status --project wherewasi  # Project-specific alert history
doggo alerts --severity critical  # Filter by config-defined severity
doggo test-rule "CI Pipeline Failure"  # Test alert logic
```

### Integration with Current System
- Webhook receiver enhanced to check for project configs
- Config rules applied to incoming webhook data
- Backward compatible with current simple webhook approach

## üìä Value Proposition

### For Solo Developers
- **Smart Filtering**: Only alert on things that matter to each project
- **Context Awareness**: Alerts that speak the project's language
- **Learning Patterns**: Monitoring improves as projects evolve

### For Ecosystem Development
- **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Changes in uroboro might affect wherewasi
- **Consistency**: Same monitoring patterns across all QRY tools
- **Scalability**: Add new projects with proven monitoring templates

## üö® Potential Pitfalls

### Complexity Creep
- Config files could become as complex as the systems they monitor
- Need to maintain "simple webhook" option for basic use cases

### Maintenance Overhead
- Each project needs monitoring config maintenance
- Config validation and testing required

### Over-Engineering Risk
- Current webhook approach works well for MVP
- Config files might be premature optimization

## üéØ Decision Framework

**Implement config files when:**
- ‚úÖ Multiple projects need different alert patterns
- ‚úÖ Cross-project relationships become important
- ‚úÖ Users request project-specific monitoring rules
- ‚úÖ Template patterns emerge across QRY ecosystem

**Stick with webhooks when:**
- ‚ùå Current system meets all needs
- ‚ùå Complexity would outweigh benefits
- ‚ùå No clear demand for project-specific patterns

## üîÆ Future Vision

**The Ultimate Goal**: Monitoring configs that learn and evolve

```yaml
# AI-enhanced monitoring configuration
learning:
  patterns:
    - "User always acknowledges database migration alerts"
    - "CI failures on Friday evenings are usually ignored"
    - "Security alerts during business hours get immediate attention"
  
  adaptations:
    - "Lower priority for Friday evening CI failures"
    - "Auto-acknowledge routine database migration patterns"
    - "Escalate security alerts during business hours"
```
